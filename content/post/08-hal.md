Eighth lab (we're about halfway now, right?!)

Today, we'll (try to) have a self-contained discussion of the Highly Adaptive
LASSO (HAL), a nonparametric regression estimator with unique and powerful
optimality properties. We'll review some of the key theoretical properties of
the estimator discussed in the lecture component of the class and then begin to
apply HAL by using the [`hal9001` R
package](https://github.com/jeremyrcoyle/hal9001).
