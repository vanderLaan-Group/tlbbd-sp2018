_Ninth lab:_ Today, we'll begin the first part of a discussion of influence
functions, which measure several important properties of estimators. After
reviewing a few of the topics introduced in the lecture, we'll dive into looking
at the origin of the theory of influence functions, and we'll wrap up the first
part of our conversation by connecting these ideas to causal inference,
specifically by looking at how we can make use of influence functions to
construct robust estimators for parameters defined within causal models.
