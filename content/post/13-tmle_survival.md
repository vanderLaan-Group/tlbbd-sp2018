We're almost done -- our penultimate lab! Today, we'll bring together our last
two discussions on survival analysis and computing TMLEs by taking a look at how
to derive and compute TMLEs in survival settings. We'll focus primarily on how
to apply the [`survtmle` R
package](https://github.com/benkeser/survtmle) to compute TMLEs in time-to-event
settings.
