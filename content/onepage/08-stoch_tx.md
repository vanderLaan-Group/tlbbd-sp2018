## Lab 8: Computational Causal Inference: Stochastic Treatment Regimes

Here we revisit a discussion on stochastic treatment regimes and how such rules
can be implemented when performing simulations. We first review the notion of a
stochastic treatment rule and how such treatment rules related to dynamic
treatment allocation strategies. We will step away from examining specific R
packages and instead place our focus on analyzing the effects of such
probabilistic interventions using rigorous simulation studies.
