## Lab 10: The Highly Adaptive LASSO

Today, we'll (try to) have a self-contained discussion of the Highly Adaptive
LASSO (HAL), a nonparametric regression estimator endowed with powerful
optimality properties and defined using the class of functions of bounded
variation norm. We'll review some of the key theoretical properties of
the estimator discussed in the lecture component of the class and then begin to
apply HAL by using the [`hal9001` R
package](https://github.com/jeremyrcoyle/hal9001).
