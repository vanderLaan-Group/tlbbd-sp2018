## Lab 3: Structural Causal Models, Interventions, and Identifiability (part 1)

Welcome to our third lab. Here we'll begin discussing a few of the foundational
principles of statistical causal inference, including structural causal models
(SCMs), interventions, and the notion of identifiability. We'll draw from
several references, including our two Targeted Learning texts, as well as the
[Judea Pearl's _Causality: Models, Reasoning, and
Inference_](https://books.google.com/books/about/Causality.html?id=wnGU_TsW3BQC),
a canonical reference.
