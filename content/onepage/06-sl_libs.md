## Lab 6: Super Learner Libraries and Screening Algorithms

In our sixth lab meeting, we'll continue discussing Super Learning, an optimal
approach to ensemble machine learning. Here, we'll dive into how to construct
algorithmic libraries over which to apply the cross-validation selector that
forms the heart of the Super Learning procedure. We'll also discuss how to
perform variable (or observation) screening within this framework. To wrap up,
we'll apply these procedures using the [`sl3` R
package](https://github.com/jeremyrcoyle/sl3).
