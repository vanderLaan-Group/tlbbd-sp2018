## Lab 4: Cross-Validation for Error Assessment

For our fourth lab, we're switching gears from causal inference to statistical
estimation. We will go through an introduction to cross-validation, a technique
that ensures we obtain honest estimates of the error of a given statistical
estimation technique by splitting data splitting. We will also discuss the very
general implementation of cross-validation in the recently developed [`origami`
R package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=origami).
