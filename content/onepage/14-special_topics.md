## Lab 14: Special Topics in Targeted Learning

Our last lab meeting! Since this class has been a constant sequence of "I wish
there were more time" moments (a lot like life, no?), we'll wrap up on a fitting
note -- a rapid discussion of special topics and recent developments in the
world of Targeted Learning. We'll (try to) discuss variable importance measures,
data-adaptive target parameters, cross-validated TMLEs, TMLEs with doubly robust
inferential properties, the general IPCW-TMLE, and TMLEs with
constraint-specific paths. Our goal here will be to explore what's possible in
the Targeted Learning framework in breadth -- we'll leave obtaining a deep
understanding of these topics as an "exercise to the reader" (i.e., your future
selves). This class isn't the end of road -- hope to see you in the next one!
