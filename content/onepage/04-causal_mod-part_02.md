## Lab 4: Structural Causal Models, Interventions, and Identifiability (part 2)

For our fourth lab, we'll continue our discussion of statistical causal
inference, examining structural causal models in greater detail. We'll expand on
our conversation from last week by introducing how estimation may be performed
using causal models, concluding with an introduction to inverse probability
weighted (IPW) estimators.
