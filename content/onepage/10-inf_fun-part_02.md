## Lab 10: Estimation and Inference with Influence Functions (part 2)

Welcome to our _tenth_ lab. Today, we'll continue our discussion of influence
functions and their properties. Here, we'll mainly discuss how influence
functions can be used to construct robust estimators of causal parameters, with
an emphasis on the role that influence functions play in the estimation of
asymptotically linear parameters.
