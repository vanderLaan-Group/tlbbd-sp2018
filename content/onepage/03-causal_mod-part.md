## Lab 3: Structural Causal Models, Interventions, and Identifiability

Welcome to our third lab. Here we'll begin discussing a few of the foundational
principles of statistical causal inference, including structural causal models
(SCMs), interventions, and the notion of identifiability. We'll draw from
several references, including our two Targeted Learning texts, as well as
[Judea Pearl's _Causality: Models, Reasoning, and
Inference_](https://books.google.com/books/about/Causality.html?id=wnGU_TsW3BQC),
a canonical reference.
