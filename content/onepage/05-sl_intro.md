## Lab 5: Introduction to the Super Learner Algorithm

Now that we've set the stage, for our fifth lab we'll begin discussing flexible,
data-adaptive estimation (i.e., machine learning), including the asymptotically
optimal ensemble learning algorithm, Super Learner. We'll dive into how to apply
the Super Learning approach using the new [`sl3` R
package](https://github.com/jeremyrcoyle/sl3).
