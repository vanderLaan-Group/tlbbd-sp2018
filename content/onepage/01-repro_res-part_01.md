## Lab 1: Reproducible Research with R, git, and GitHub (part 1)

Our first lab for Targeted Learning in Biomedical Big Data is a simple
introduction to computationally reproducible research with R, git, and GitHub.
We'll discuss the importance of computational reproducibility and set some
standards for how these principles apply to the work we'll do in this class.
