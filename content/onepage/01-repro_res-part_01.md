## Lab 1: Reproducible Research with R, git, GitHub I

Our first lab for Targeted Learning in Biomedical Big Data is a simple
introduction to computationally reproducible research with R, git, and GitHub.
We'll discuss the importance of computational reproducibility and set some
standards for how these principles apply to the work we'll do in this class.

### Resources

* [Version Control with git (Software
    Carpentry)](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
* [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis (Software
    Carpentry)](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/)
* [Tools for Reproducible Research (Karl Broman)](http://kbroman.org/Tools4RR/)
* [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR (Jenny Bryan)](http://happygitwithr.com/)

_The above resources provide a mechanism to remedy any deficiencies that may be
present in background knowledge on scientific computing. You may wish to consult
them regularly as the course progresses._
