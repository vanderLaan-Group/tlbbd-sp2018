## Lab 11: Super Learning in Survival Analysis

Welcome back from Spring break and to our _eleventh_ lab. Today, we'll discuss a
new type of data structure: time-to-event outcomes. Time-to-event processes are
the focus of a sub-discipline of statistics known as _survival analysis_. Data
arising in this setting are _longitudinal_ in nature, as opposed to the mainly
cross-sectional type of data we have been discussing so far. We'll discuss a few
of the mathematical formalisms that arise in survival analysis, go on to discuss
nonparametric estimation with data of this type, and then take a look at how to
apply the Super Learning approach to data-adaptively estimate quantities of
interest in this setting.
